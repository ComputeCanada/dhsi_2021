* Our training JupyterHub

For this session and for all sessions tomorrow, you are welcome to use our training JupyterHub on which all Python packages are installed and where the data is already downloaded. It will make getting setup a lot easier and faster.

To access the JupyterHub, you will need a username and password that I will give you in this course and you can find instructions in {{<a "https://dhsi-2021.netlify.app/help/#headline-22" "our help page">}}.

The username and password will remain valid for the entire week, so write them down somewhere and keep them at hand.
