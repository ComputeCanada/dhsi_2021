#+BEGIN_box
*Heads-up*

This session is conceptual rather than hands-on.\\
I will explain what machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, and NLP are and I will demo an example of using NLP for sentiment analysis, but you will not get to play with Python code.

* Resources

- {{<a "https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/" "Stanza">}} is a Python NLP package developed by the {{<a "https://nlp.stanford.edu/" "Stanford NLP Group">}}
- Since many of you have interests in Russian literature, {{<a "https://russiannlp.sites.stanford.edu/resources" "here">}} is a set of interesting resources
- {{<a "https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/" "Speech and Language Processing">}} is a book by {{<a "https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/" "Dan Jurafsky">}} and {{<a "https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/" "James Martin">}} with a free online version
- The {{<a "http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/" "CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning">}} Stanford University course has many resources available on its site

* Example

Let's go through an example of NLP using {{<a "https://github.com/fastai/fastai" "fastai.">}} I am using here one of their demo examples.

Below is the code that I will run. Because we only have one GPU and because it would take an extremely long time to run this code on CPUs, unfortunately, you will have to watch and you won't be able to run this on your JupyterLab.

#+BEGIN_src python
# First, we load the necessary functions from fastai
# Note that import * is appropriate with fastai
# but not a very good practice with other packages
from fastai.text.all import *

# Then we build our data loaders
# This is an object of the fastai class DataLoaders
# It contains a validation data loader and a training data loader
dls = TextDataLoaders.from_folder(
    '/project/def-sponsor00/dhsi/.fastai/data/imdb',
    valid='test'
)

# Let's have a look at the data
dls.show_batch()

# Now, we define our learner
# AWD_LSTM is the architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182)
learn = text_classifier_learner(dls, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5, metrics=accuracy)

# Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained model with our data
# over 2 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-2
learn.fine_tune(2, 1e-2)

# Then we can use our model to predict whether sentences are positive or negative
learn.predict("This is amazing.")
learn.predict("I love it.")
learn.predict("This is terrible.")
